# CarRegistrations
I have created a mock SQL DB for US car registrations and their owners. I created the SQL DB through the CarRegistrationsTableCreation.sql file and then populated that database through the Program.cs file and supporting .txt files.</br>
</br>
Steps:</br>
1. Download all files.</br>
2. In SSMS, run the CarRegistrationsTableCreation.sql file to create the database, tables, and constraints.</br>
3. In VS, add the standard Program.cs file.</br>
4. Change all values required in script before build and run:</br>
  a. locations of files</br>
  b. number of values to add</br>
5. Run the script.</br>
